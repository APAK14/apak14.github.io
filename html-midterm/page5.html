    <h3>Page 1</h3>

        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 2</h3>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 3</h3>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 4</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 </li>
        <li>Table order</li>
        <li>Missing code</li>
      </ul>  
    <p>For page 4, the first thing that was missing was the <!DOCTYPE html> in line 1. The main thing that was wrong for the code was the placement of the pictures. </p>
