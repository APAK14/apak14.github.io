    <h1>Corrections Made on Pages 1-4 Midterm</h1>
    <h5><span style="font-weight:normal">Alexis Pak</span></h5>

    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 2</h3>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 3</h3>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">"  </p>

    <h3>Page 4</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 </li>
        <li>Table order</li>
        <li>Missing code</li>
        <li>Need to have an alternative name for the pictures</li>
      </ul>  
    <p>For page 4, the first thing that was missing was the <!DOCTYPE html> in line 1. Without that piece of code, the code wouldn't render correctly.</p>
    <p>The main thing that was wrong with the code was the placement of the pictures. The code goes by rows and not colomns, so the order needed to be changed. so the correct picture goes to the correct label list above the pictures.</p>
    <p>That was another mistake. There were two pictures above the labels and that was because both the orange cat and creature didn't have <td> before img. td needs to be there because we need to express that the picture is part of the table data. For the singing dog, it was also missing the ending to express it is table data, </td> </p>
    <p>The last thing that needed to be fixed was to add alt= after the source of the pictures. The alt is to describe why the image connects to the page. </p>
