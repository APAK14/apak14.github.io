    <h1>Corrections Made on Pages 1-4 Midterm</h1>

    <h3>Page 1</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>First two lines</li>
        <li>Ending tag mistakes</li>
        <li>Header size</li>
      </ul>
    <p>For this page, The very top of the code didn't have "DOCTYPE html and html lang="en". Without <i>DOCTYPE html</i>, the code wouldn't render correctly. Without <i>html lang="en"</i>, then the web wouldn't know the language in the text.</p>
    <p>On paragraph 6, the ending tag for the paragraph was incomplete and needed the /p. Then in paragraph 7, to make <em>cr√®me fraiche</em> italicized, the ending tag was only e, but it need to be /em. The tags could also be just "i". If the ending tag is incorrect, then the rest of the text after it will be italicized as well. Also, according to the source page the header with "by..." the by needed to be italicized as well.</p>
    <p>For the top three headers of the page, They were incorrect sizes according to the reference page. So I changed the date to be h3 and not bold, the title of the article to be h1, and then the authors name to be h2.</p>

    <h3>Page 2</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixing tags</li>
        <li>Header size</li>
        <li>Adding link</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In the first sentence of the article, "The New Beehive Inn..." <i>New Beehive</i> needed to be bold and the starting tag was correct, but the ending tag was missing some components which made the whole page bold. The ending tag needed to have /b inside of the <>.  </p>
    <p>For the Interior header, there were a couple of things. According to the source page, <i>Interior</i> needed to be a smaller header compared to the other headers, but at first it was bigger. The second thing that needed to be fixed was the organization of the tags. We need to say that Interior is a header before we want to make it bold. So we needed to switch the bold tag with the header tag. Not only was Interior the wrong size for the header, <i>History</i> was too small at h6 and needed to match with the other headers at h3. </p>
    <p>There was a link missing to one of the elements for <i>segmental arch</i>. I then added a link to the correct page it was ment to go to.</p>


    <h3>Page 3</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Bullet in the list</li>
        <li>link to a resource</li>
        <li>The whole messy table</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This page had a really messy table, but before we talk about the table, there was a mistake with one of the tags in the bullet list. The third row of the list didn't have a bullet next it. It only had l instead of li for the starting and ending tag. </p>
    <p>Under the list, the word <i>header</i> had a resource link symbol [6] next to it but with no resource link attached, so I added the link that goes to [6].</p>
    <p>Now for the table, there needed to be border lines, so I went into the style function and added borders around the table, headers, and data. </p>
    <p>Then, the whole organization of the table was off. Lily's ending tag needed to have td and she was in the wrong row and needed to go to the start of row 4. She is also 18 years old and not 36. The Age for Olatunkbo was also in the wrong row and needed to be moved back to row 5. Axelia decided to not be apart of the group, but they need to go in a row, so they were moved down to be apart of the 6th row. Then the rest of the table was missing according to the reference page so I added them. </p>

    <h3>Page 4</h3>
    <h4>Mistakes Fixed</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 </li>
        <li>Table order</li>
        <li>Missing code</li>
        <li>Need to have an alternative name for the pictures</li>
      </ul>  
    <p>For page 4, the first thing that was missing was the <i>DOCTYPE html</i> in line 1. Without that piece of code, the code wouldn't render correctly.</p>
    <p>The main thing that was wrong with the code was the placement of the pictures. The code goes by rows and not colomns, so the order needed to be changed. so the correct picture goes to the correct label list above the pictures.</p>
    <p>That was another mistake. There were two pictures above the labels and that was because both the orange cat and creature didn't have <td> before img. td needs to be there because we need to express that the picture is part of the table data. For the singing dog, it was also missing the ending to express it is table data, </td> </p>
    <p>The last thing that needed to be fixed was to add alt= after the source of the pictures. The alt is to describe why the image connects to the page. </p>
