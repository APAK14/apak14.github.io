        <p>I'm majoring in Creative Technology and Design with a minor in Media Production. I am creating a website through one of my classes (Web, ATLS 2200) to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Coding is not my strongest suit, but I believe by taking Web, I will be able to learn how to appreciate learning how to code for my own personal benefit. When I'm not working on school work, you can usually find me traveling and experiencing new cultures or practicing Taekwondo. I have been fortunate to have traveled to over 30 countries and I am aiming to get my 4th dan (master belt) in Taekwondo.</p>
