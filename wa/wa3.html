    <h3>Regional history</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>East Asia</h4>
    <h5>Mainland China</h5>
    <p>Spring rolls are a <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_food”>seasonal food</a> consumed during the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)”>spring</a>, and started as a pancake filled with the new season's spring vegetables, a welcome change from the preserved foods of the long winter months<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-Sri_Owen-1”>[1]</a>. In <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine”>name</a>Chinese cuisine, spring rolls are savoury rolls with <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage”>cabbage</a>cabbage and other vegetable fillings inside a thinly wrapped cylindrical pastry. They are usually eaten during the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year”>Spring Festival</a> in mainland China, hence the name. Meat varieties, particularly pork, are also popular. Fried spring rolls are generally small and crisp. They can be sweet or savoury; the former often with red bean paste filling, and the latter are typically prepared with vegetables. They are fully wrapped before being <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_frying”>pan-fried</a> or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_frying”>deep-fried</a>.</p>
    <p>Non-fried spring rolls are typically bigger and more savoury. Unlike fried spring rolls, non-fried ones are typically made by filling the wrapping with pre-cooked ingredients. Traditionally, they are a festive food eaten during the Cold Food Day festival and the Tomb Sweeping Day festival in spring to remember and pay respect to ancestors. The Hakka population sometimes also eats spring rolls on the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar (三月三 sān yuè sān). The wrappings can be a flour-based mix or batter.</p>
    <h5>Hong Kong and Macau</h5>
    <p>Spring roll is a fried dish usually available as a dim sum.[2] They typically contain minced pork, shredded carrot, bean sprouts and other vegetables served with dipping sauce.</p>
    <h5>Taiwan</h5>
    <p>In Taiwan, the most commonly eaten non-fried spring rolls are popiah, called rùn bǐng (潤餅) in Mandarin or po̍h-piáⁿ (薄餅) in Hokkien. In northern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally flavoured with herbs, stir-fried, and sometimes topped with a finely ground peanut powder before being wrapped. In southern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally boiled or blanched in plain water. Sometimes caster or super fine sugar is added along with the peanut powder before all the ingredients are wrapped.</p>

    <p>Lumpia is the name for spring rolls in Indonesia[3] and the Philippines, which was derived from Southern Chinese spring rolls. The name lumpia derives from Hokkien lunpia (Chinese: 潤餅; pinyin: rùnbǐng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: jūn-piáⁿ, lūn-piáⁿ) and was introduced in the Philippine islands during the 17th century.[4] It is a savoury snack made of thin crepe pastry skin enveloping a mixture of savoury fillings, consists of chopped vegetables; carrots, cabbages, green beans, bamboo shoots, banana heart and leeks, or sometimes also minced meat; chicken, shrimp, pork or beef.[5] It is often served as an appetizer or snack, and might be served deep fried or fresh (unfried). In both Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, it is called popiah similar to in Taiwan, while in Myanmar, it is referred as kawpyan (ကော်ပြန့်).[6] In Cambodia, it is called nem jien.[7] It requires almost the same ingredients as the other recipes from its neighbouring countries but Cambodians also use vermicelli noodles and taro root or daikon radish. Cambodians also make their own tangy dipping sauce to dip the spring rolls in.[8][9]</p>
