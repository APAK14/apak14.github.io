    <h3>Regional history</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>East Asia</h4>
    <h5>Mainland China</h5>
    <p>Spring rolls are a <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_food”>seasonal food</a> consumed during the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season)”>spring</a>, and started as a pancake filled with the new season's spring vegetables, a welcome change from the preserved foods of the long winter months<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-Sri_Owen-1”>[1]</a>. In <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine”>name</a>Chinese cuisine, spring rolls are savoury rolls with <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage”>cabbage</a>cabbage and other vegetable fillings inside a thinly wrapped cylindrical pastry. They are usually eaten during the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year”>Spring Festival</a> in mainland China, hence the name. Meat varieties, particularly pork, are also popular. Fried spring rolls are generally small and crisp. They can be sweet or savoury; the former often with red bean paste filling, and the latter are typically prepared with vegetables. They are fully wrapped before being <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_frying”>pan-fried</a> or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_frying”>deep-fried</a>.</p>
    <p>Non-fried spring rolls are typically bigger and more savoury. Unlike fried spring rolls, non-fried ones are typically made by filling the wrapping with pre-cooked ingredients. Traditionally, they are a festive food eaten during the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Food_Festival”>Cold Food Day festival</a> and the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival”>Tomb Sweeping Day festival</a> in spring to remember and pay respect to <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestor_worship”>ancestors</a>. The <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people”>Hakka</a> population sometimes also eats spring rolls on the third day of the third month of the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar”>lunar calendar</a> (三月三 sān yuè sān). The wrappings can be a <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour”>flour</a>-based mix or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter_(cooking)”>batter</a>.</p>
    <h5>Hong Kong and Macau</h5>
    <p>Spring roll is a fried dish usually available as a <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum”>dim sum</a>.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-yeinjee-2”>[2]</a> They typically contain minced pork, shredded carrot, bean sprouts and other vegetables served with <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipping_sauce”>dipping sauce</a>.</p>
    <h5>Taiwan</h5>
    <p>In <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan”>Taiwan</a>, the most commonly eaten non-fried spring rolls are <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popiah”>popiah</a>, called rùn bǐng (潤餅) in <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese”>Mandarin</a> or po̍h-piáⁿ (薄餅) in Hokkien. In northern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally flavoured with <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbs”>herbs</a>, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stir-fried”>stir-fried</a>, and sometimes topped with a finely ground <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut”>peanut</a> powder before being wrapped. In southern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally boiled or blanched in plain water. Sometimes <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar#Culinary_sugars”>caster</a> or super fine <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar”>sugar</a> is added along with the peanut powder before all the ingredients are wrapped.</p>
    <h4>Southeast Asia</h4>
    <h5>Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore</h5>
    <p><i>Main articles: <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpia”>Lumpia</a> and <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popiah”>Popiah</a></i></p>
    <p><a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpia”>Lumpia</a> is the name for spring rolls in <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_cuisine”>Indonesia</a> <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-3”>[3]</a> and the <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_cuisine”>Philippines</a>, which was derived from Southern Chinese spring rolls. The name lumpia derives from <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien_language”>Hokkien</a> lunpia (<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters”>Chinese</a>: 潤餅; <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin”>pinyin</a>: rùnbǐng; <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB”>Pe̍h-ōe-jī</a>: jūn-piáⁿ, lūn-piáⁿ) and was introduced in the Philippine islands during the 17th century.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-afr-4”>[4]</a> It is a savoury snack made of thin <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepe”>crepe</a> pastry skin enveloping a mixture of savoury fillings, consists of chopped vegetables; carrots, cabbages, green beans, bamboo shoots, banana heart and leeks, or sometimes also minced meat; chicken, shrimp, pork or beef.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-Phil-Kitchen-5”>[5]</a> It is often served as an <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetizer”>appetizer</a> or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack”>snack</a>, and might be served <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_fried”>deep fried</a> or fresh (unfried). In both <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_cuisine”>Malaysia</a>, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_cuisine”>Singapore</a> and <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_cuisine”>Thailand</a>, it is called popiah similar to in Taiwan, while in <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_cuisine”>Myanmar</a>, it is referred as kawpyan (ကော်ပြန့်).<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-6”>[6]</a> In <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_cuisine”>Cambodia</a>, it is called nem jien.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-7”>[7]</a> It requires almost the same ingredients as the other recipes from its neighbouring countries but Cambodians also use vermicelli noodles and taro root or daikon radish. Cambodians also make their own tangy dipping sauce to dip the spring rolls in.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-8”>[8]</a> <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-9”>[9]</a></p>
    <h5>Vietnam</h5>
    <p><i>Main articles: <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3_gi%C3%B2”>Chả giò</a> and <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%E1%BB%8Fi_cu%E1%BB%91n”>gỏi cuốn</a></i></p>
    <p>The fried version with minced pork is called imperial rolls or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3_gi%C3%B2”>chả giò</a> (southern Vietnam), nem cuốn, chả cuốn or Nem rán (northern Vietnam). They are often called "egg rolls" in Western countries, which is a misnomer. Central Vietnam has its own version of a fried roll called “ram”. Ram is always made from whole shell-on shrimp or chopped de-shelled shrimp and some green onions, wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. Like most speciality food items from central Vietnam, Ram is not widely available in Vietnamese restaurants overseas.</p>
    <p>A Vietnamese imperial roll is different from a Chinese spring roll in that it is typically smaller and contains ground or chopped meats/seafood such as pork, crab, shrimp, chicken, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro”>taro</a> or <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava”>cassava</a>, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellophane_noodles”>glass noodles</a>, wood-ear fungi or oyster mushrooms, and shredded carrots. <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_paper”>Rice paper</a> is traditionally used as wrappers. However, several Vietnamese restaurants in Western countries may use Chinese spring roll wrappers due to the unavailability of rice paper or ease of use.</p>
    <p>Spring rolls or summer rolls are a Vietnamese delicacy known as “gỏi cuốn”. Depending on the region, salad rolls were made differently. Some vegetarian families make vegetarian spring rolls rather than meat spring rolls.<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-10”>[10]</a> However, the typical ingredients include slivers of cooked pork (most often <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3”>cha</a> pork sausages), shrimp, sometimes chicken or tofu, fresh herbs like basil or cilantro, lettuce, cucumbers, sometimes fresh garlic, chives, rice vermicelli, all wrapped in moistened rice paper. A typical “gỏi cuốn” may only contain boiled pork, boiled rice noodles, cucumber, carrot and herbs. Fresh Vietnamese spring rolls can be made at home or found at Vietnamese restaurants<a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-11”>[11]</a> <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#cite_note-12”>[12]</a> and some grocery stores. They are served at room temperature with dipping sauce. <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_ch%E1%BA%A5m”>Nước chấm</a>, <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C6%B0%C6%A1ng”>tương</a> xào, or a <a href = “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoisin”>hoisin</a> peanut sauce are all common dipping sauces. A typical hoisin dipping sauce includes chilli, hoisin sauce, peanut butter and sugar. A standard "nước mắm pha" (nước chấm) dipping sauce is composed of fish sauce, lime, garlic, sugar, and chillies or simply fish sauce, sugar and vinegar.</p>
